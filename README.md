# KittySketchSwift

KittySketchSwift is an iOS application that demonstrates the power of SwiftUI by creating and animating a custom-drawn object using `Path`. The app features an interactive cat sketch where users can toggle a "dream" mode, causing the cat to dream of fish, changing the background, and animating clouds or fish across the screen.

## Features

- **Custom Object Creation:** The cat and all related elements (like its eyes, bow, and ears) are drawn entirely using SwiftUI's `Path`, showcasing the ability to create complex shapes and figures programmatically.
- **Interactive Animation:** The app features a "dream" mode where users can see the cat's environment change, with dynamic animations of clouds and fish moving across the screen.
- **SwiftUI Animations:** Smooth animations created using SwiftUI's animation tools bring the cat and its dreams to life, adding depth and interaction to the experience.
- **Geometric Abstraction:** The cat itself is a playful abstraction created using basic geometric shapes, illustrating how SwiftUI can be used to craft visually appealing and interactive designs.

## What I Learned

- **Path and Shape in SwiftUI:** Gained proficiency in using `Path` to create custom geometric shapes and objects in SwiftUI.
- **SwiftUI Animations:** Implemented smooth, continuous animations using SwiftUI, focusing on performance and user engagement.
- **State-Driven UI:** Leveraged SwiftUI's state management to control animations and UI updates in response to user interactions.
- **Creative Expression with Code:** Explored creative possibilities by combining coding with design, bringing a custom-drawn character to life through animations.
